        <h1>BELEIVER</h1>
        <p><strong>First things first</strong>
          I'ma say all the words inside my head
          I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
          The way that things have been, <em>oh-ooh</em></p>
       <p><strong>Second thing second</strong>
        Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
        The master of my sea,</p>
         <p1>oh-ooh</p1>
        <p>I was broken from a young age
          Taking my sulking to the masses
          Writing my poems for the few
          That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
          ...
           </p>
          <p1>Pain!</p1> 

        <p>You made me a, you made me a believer, believer!
        </p>
        <p1>Pain!</p1>
        
        <p>You break me down and build me up, believer, believer</p>
        <p1>Pain!</p1>
        <p>Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
          My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
          <em>Pain!</em>
          You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
          First things first</p>
        <p>Can you imagine what's about to happen?
          It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
          And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
          This is what's happenin'
          </p>
          <p><em>Second thing second</em>, I reckon immaculate
            Sound about accurate
          I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
          I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
          I know the passages come with some traffic
          I start with from the basement, end up in the attic</p>
        <p>Third thing third
        Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
          Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
          Is you a believer?</p>
          <p>I get a unicorn out of a zebra
            I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
            This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
            Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
            I know the bloomin' don't come without rain</p>
          <p>I know the losin' don't come without shame
            I know the beauty don't come without hurt
            Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last</p>
          <p>I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
          I know that losin' don't come without game
          I know that glory don't come without...
          Don't come without...</p>
        <p1>Pain!</p1>
        <p2>BELEIVER , BELEIVER!!!</p2>
